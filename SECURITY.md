## Supported Versions

| Branch / Version     | Supported |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| `main` (pre‑release) | ✅         |
| Any tagged release   | n/a       |

Once semantic‑versioned releases begin (e.g., **v1.0.0**), this table will list which lines receive security updates and for how long.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure. **Please do not open public issues for security problems.**

### Preferred methods

1. **GitHub private advisory** – Repository ▸ *Security* ▸ *Advisories* ▸ **Report a vulnerability**.
   This keeps the report private to maintainers.
2. **Email**: `dev.adak.ie@outlook.com` with the subject line `SECURITY: <short summary>`.

Include the following so we can reproduce the issue quickly:

* Affected component / file / endpoint
* Steps to reproduce or proof‑of‑concept
* Potential impact (e.g., data leak, RCE)
* Suggested remediation if known

### What to expect

| Stage               | Target timeframe                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledge receipt | **≤ 3 business days**                                |
| Status updates      | **Weekly** until resolution                          |
| Fix availability    | **30 days** max (critical issues prioritized sooner) |
| Public disclosure   | Coordinated with reporter, post‑release              |

If a report is ineligible (duplicate, non‑issue, out of scope) we’ll explain why.

## Credit & CVEs

*We appreciate your help!* Unless anonymity is requested, reporters are credited in the release notes.

For high‑severity issues we will request a CVE ID and include it in the advisory and changelog.
